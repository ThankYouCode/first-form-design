A webform , web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data  that is sent to a server for processing .  Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the  forms using checkboxes , radio buttons , or text fields.

For example , forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order 
a product , or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine .

Most areas where you can input information into web pages are created using 
HTML forms , for example entering text or numbers into a text box , checking a 
tick box , causing a radio button to " fill in " , or selecting an option from 
a list.
The form is then usually submitted to the web site when you submit the form , 
and the data is used in some way , for example customer details being stored in 
a database for later use , or a web site being instantly updated after a buyer 
chooses a product to look at or comments on a blog post.
